SPLAT setup for beacon 

You will need splat (it's in Fedora and Ubuntu repos, but you can also obtain it from https://www.qsl.net/kd2bd/splat.html) 

download_data.sh downloads nearby data from beacon (requires wget, unzip and srtm2sdf to be in path, the latter is part of splat) 

Then run.sh calculates/plots power loss contours from beacon. You need splat and convert to be in the path (convert is used to convert from ppm to png).
